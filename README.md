# Breast Cancer Prediction

The objective of this project is to create a predictive model that can accurately classify breast
cancer cases as benign or malignant based on a set of relevant features.

**Dataset overview**
> 1. **Age: Age of the patient at the time of diagnosis.**
> 2. **Menopause status: Whether the patient has undergone menopause or not.**
> 3. **Tumor size: The size of the tumor in millimeters.**
> 4. **Number of involved lymph nodes: The number of lymph nodes that contain cancer cells.**
> 5. **Node caps status: Whether the cancer cells have spread to the lymph node capsule or not.**
> 6. **Degree of malignancy: The degree to which the cancer cells differ from normal cells.**
> 7. **Breast quadrant location: The quadrant of the breast where the tumor is located.**
> 8. **Radiation therapy: Whether or not the patient received radiation therapy after surgery.**
